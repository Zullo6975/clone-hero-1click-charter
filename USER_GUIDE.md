# 1-Click Charter User Guide

## Installation

1. **Extract the Zip:** Unzip the downloaded file.
2. **Run the App:** Double-click `1ClickCharter` (macOS) or `1ClickCharter.exe` (Windows).
    * *Note (macOS):* If you see "App is damaged" or "Unidentified Developer", right-click the app and select **Open**, then click **Open** again in the dialog.

## How to Chart a Song

1. **Drag & Drop:** Drag an audio file (mp3, wav, flac, ogg) into the **"Input Audio"** box.
2. **Metadata:** Fill in the Song Title and Artist. (The app tries to guess these for you!)
3. **Cover Art (Optional):** Drag a square image (png/jpg) into the **"Album Art"** box.
4. **Output:** Select where you want the song folder to be saved (e.g., your Clone Hero `Songs` folder).
5. **Generate:** Click the blue **"GENERATE CHART"** button at the bottom right.

## Queue Mode (Batch Processing)

To chart an entire album at once:

1. Drag a **Folder** or **Multiple Files** into the Input Audio box.
2. The app will load the **first** song immediately.
3. Fill in the details for Song #1 and click **Generate**.
4. Once finished, the app will **automatically load Song #2**.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty!

## Tips

* **Difficulty:** Use the "Advanced Settings" to choose a preset. "Medium (Balanced)" is recommended for most songs.
* **Logs:** If generation fails, click "Show Logs" at the bottom right to see what happened.
* **Updates:** Check the GitHub Releases page for new versions.
