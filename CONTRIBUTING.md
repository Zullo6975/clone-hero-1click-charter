This project prioritizes **playability over accuracy**.

Before proposing changes, understand the core philosophy:

- Medium difficulty is a hard ceiling
- Charts must remain readable and predictable
- If a rule conflict occurs, the chart simplifies
- Musical feel beats technical precision

---

## What to Optimize For

- Fun and comfort
- Groove-locked timing
- Intentional movement
- Tasteful variety
- Clear, debuggable logic

---

## What Not to Optimize For

- Perfect transcription
- Maximum difficulty
- Genre-specific gimmicks
- Model complexity over rules
- Edge-case correctness at the cost of feel

---

## Development Principles

- Prefer explicit rules over learned models
- Favor determinism and repeatability
- Small heuristics > big abstractions
- Avoid adding user-facing knobs unless justified

If a change makes charts harder to play, it must be justified **and** measurable.
