This project prioritizes **playability over accuracy**.

Before proposing changes, please understand the core philosophy:

- Medium difficulty is a hard ceiling
- No Orange lane, no Expert mechanics
- If a rule conflict occurs, the chart must simplify
- Consistency and readability matter more than precision

## What to Optimize For

- Fun and comfort
- Predictable patterns
- Controlled speed and movement
- Clean, readable code

## What Not to Optimize For

- Perfect transcription
- Maximum difficulty
- Genre-specific gimmicks
- Overfitting to edge cases

## Development Notes

- Prefer clear rules over complex models
- Favor determinism and debuggability
- Avoid adding user-facing knobs unless necessary

If a change makes charts harder to play, it must be justified.
